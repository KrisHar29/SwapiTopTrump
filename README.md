# SwapiTopTrump

Making a console app (so far) to use data from SWAPI.dev to play Top Trumps.

===12-14/04===

Made quite a few changes, added a PlayerModel and refactored code input and parameter values to reflect the new model. Corrected some bugs that were throwing OutOfRange exceptions. Hardcoded more card values and increased chooseable options with logic for 2 additional fields (4 total choices)

===14/03===

App is working as of 14/03 but is limited to only Height, Mass and 5 Hardcoded card values. There are some bugs to iron out with cheatmode not displaying correct win% some turns (with possibility of making it more accurate based on opponents hand cards etc as apposed to its current total cards)
