# SwapiTopTrump

Making a console app (so far) to use data from SWAPI.dev to play Top Trumps.

App is working as of 14/03 but is limited to only Height, Mass and 5 Hardcoded card values. There are some bugs to iron out with cheatmode not displaying correct win% some turns (with possibility of making it more accurate based on opponents hand cards etc as apposed to its current total cards)
